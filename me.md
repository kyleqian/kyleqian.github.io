My dream is to use immersive technology to create and explore worlds totally different from our own, worlds with their own set of unique rules, assumptions, and norms. Beyond expanding our collective horizons, the experience of novel realities liberates us to witness our own world with fresh eyes. How better to appreciate up being up, and down being down, than to visit a world in which neither is true?
