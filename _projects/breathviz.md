BreathViz is a series of breathing exercises that uses data streamed from a [NeuLog Monitor Belt](https://neulog.com/respiration-monitor-belt/){:target="_blank"} to provide visual biofeedback. The goal is to visually augment meditation by providing the user with an additional mode of breath perception. This was my first Unity project, originally built for iOS + Google Cardboard.

I created an importable Unity package to interface with the NeuLog belt, which can be found [here](https://github.com/kyleqian/neulog-unity){:target="_blank"}. Feel free to use it and contact me with any questions.
