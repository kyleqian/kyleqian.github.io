Stereoscopic Untethered Video See-Through Augmented Reality (SUVSTAR) was developed as the final project for EE267 - Virtual Reality at Stanford University with Dr. Gordon Wetzstein. It uses two separate ARCore-enabled devices, one per eye, to enable anchored, outdoor augmented reality. It was created as a proof-of-concept for AR HMDs of the future that users wear at all times, in any lighting, and without being tethered to a separate computation hub.
