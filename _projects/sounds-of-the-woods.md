Sounds of the Woods is an audio-based horror game for the Oculus Go. Using the Oculus Go's 3DOF controller as a flashlight to ward off the unknown, players become increasingly reliant on sonic cues as daylight grows ever weaker.

This game was created as a part of Stanford's course at CCRMA on [Neuroplasicity and Musical Gaming](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/courses/257-spring-2018/pages/overview/){:target="_blank"}, and is available for free on the Oculus Store.

You're lost and injured in the woods, and it's quickly getting dark. All you have with you is a flashlight and a radio. Help won't arrive until sunrise, so you'll have to survive the night. You see friendly woodland creatures as the sun sets, but as the sky grows darker, you begin hearing other creatures lurking in the night...

Most of these creatures are scared of light, so shining your flashlight (with limited battery) at them should make them go away. Some of them will stare from afar, and some will cautiously approach. Others will hunt you down in packs as you try to track their movement. Still others might trick you into looking where they aren't ([ventriloquist effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_capture){:target="_blank"}). Each creature has its own spatialized auditory signature, and the darker it gets, the harder it will be to locate them with only sight.

The training goals of the game include sound localization, separation of auditory signals from noise, and effective multisensory integration in dynamic environments. See [our poster]({{ site.url }}/assets/misc/257Poster_KyleAngela.pdf){:target="_blank"} for more info!
