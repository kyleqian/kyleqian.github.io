Sounds of the Woods is an audio-based horror game created for the Oculus Go. It was created as a part of Stanford's course on [Neuroplasicity and Musical Gaming](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/courses/257-spring-2018/pages/overview/){:target="_blank"}, and was released to the Oculus Store.

You're lost and injured in the woods, and it's quickly getting dark. All you have with you is a flashlight and a radio. You called for help on the radio, but it looks like it'll take until sunrise until help can arrive, so you'll have to survive the night. You see friendly woodland creatures as the sun sets, but as it gets darker, you start seeing and hearing other creatures lurking in the night...

Most of these creatures are scared of light, so shining your flashlight (which has limited battery) at them should make them go away. Some of them will just stare at you from afar and slowly come closer to you the longer you don't shoo them away. Others will make circles around you as you try to track their movements. Still others might trick you into looking where they aren't ([ventriloquist effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_capture){:target="_blank"}). Each creature has its own spatialized auditory signature, and the darker it gets, the harder it is to locate them with only sight.

The training goals of the game include sound localization, separation of auditory signals from noise, and effective multisensory integration in dynamic environments. See [our poster]({{ site.url }}/assets/misc/257Poster_KyleAngela.pdf){:target="_blank"} for more info!
