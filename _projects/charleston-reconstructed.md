## Overview

Charleston Reconstructed is a location-based AR experience aiming to democratize public spaces, challenge historical narratives, and empower silenced voices. Across three chapters taking place across Marion Square in Charleston, South Carolina, users are invited to:
1. Reflect on the past by contextualizing the monument to John C. Calhoun (physically removed in summer 2020)
2. Acknowledge the present by digitally invoking Denmark Vesey
3. Imagine a brighter future through the Door of No Return

The project was scheduled to launch in spring 2020, but progress was unfortunately halted by the pandemic. The project deck is embedded below:
