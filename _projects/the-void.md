The Void explores gaze as an esoteric control mechanic. The game is quite simple&mdash;clear the orbiting asteroids with your Seeker, which is perpetually drawn to the center of your gaze. The catch? Looking directly at your Seeker immediately destroys it.

Gaze is tracked using the [Tobii Eye Tracker 4C](https://tobiigaming.com/product/tobii-eye-tracker-4c/){:target="_blank"}.
